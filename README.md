# FantaAstaTool âš½

This tool can be used to manage the bid of the famous italian game "Fantacalcio" also know as "Fantasy Football". It's a simple, yet useful, web-interface that helps you to keep track of all the partecipants' credits and events during the bid. 

## Installation ðŸš€
The tool requires a python3 virtual environment to work (you can also decide to install flask on your pc). First of all, clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/DanieleBertagnoli/FantaAstaTool
```

After that run the installation script:

```
sudo chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

## Usage ðŸ‘¾

This tool uses Python's library named Flask, to run a local server on your device. Once started the server.py, you can use the tool by connecting to the standard address 127.0.0.0:5000. You can start a new bid or resume an already started bid by selecting the file saved by the tool. 

The final file will be saved and stored into the "Uploads" folder, placed in the same directory where the server.py file is located.

To run the web-interface, you can simply use the following commands:

```
sudo chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```
